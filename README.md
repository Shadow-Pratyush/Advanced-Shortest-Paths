# Advanced-Shortest-Paths
Advanced shortest paths project was under Algorithms on Graphs in Online Data Structures and Algorithms specialisation offered by UC San Diego and HSE National Research University.
Studies about efficient algorithms to find the shortest routes in graphs like Bidirectional Dijkstra and A* Searching algorithm.
Understood the basics of preprosessing and Contarction Hierarchies Algorithms and its aopplications.
The Python implementation of the codes is given in the repository
